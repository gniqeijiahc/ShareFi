## **Problem Statement**  
Despite the technical capabilities of existing hotspot-sharing apps like NetShare, they face challenges in motivating users to share their internet altruistically. Key issues include:  
1. **Lack of User Motivation:** Current apps focus on functionality but fail to encourage voluntary participation.  
2. **User Experience Gaps:** Unintuitive interfaces hinder seamless and rewarding user interactions.  
3. **Limited Ecosystem Formation:** Insufficient support for access point sharing and user engagement affects community-building efforts.  

This project addresses these challenges to foster a culture of internet sharing, providing low-cost, reliable connectivity for marginalized users, frequent travelers, and communities in need.
